#Example 1
#This code will not run properly as the "for loop" can not be created. It has starting point but not ending point. 
#The variable I is not well iterated. 


#Example2
0

#The while loop will generate value from 0 till 2 and as soon as the output is equal to 3, the loop breaks.


#Example 3

#The values less than 5 are generated through while loop, but the "break" command is not working due to syntax error.
